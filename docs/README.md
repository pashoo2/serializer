# serializer
An utility class for data serialization with an ability to serialize functions.

It allows to serialize objects containing functions. You can provide a context for functions which are imported, it will allow them to use a kind of an API you provided. Of course if functions have any external references those will throw an exceptions, so you should avoid that.
